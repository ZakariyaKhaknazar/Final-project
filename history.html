      <h2 style="font-size: 3vw">Kazakhstan to c. 1700 CE</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 2.3vw">The immense size and varied landscape of Kazakhstan exclude the possibility of a unified prehistoric culture covering the whole area. The Bronze Age Andronovo culture (2nd millennium BCE) spread over much of Kazakhstan; it was followed by periods dominated by nomads, producers of the “animal art” later identified with the Scythians. One can only speculate concerning the ethnic or linguistic identities of these populations; whether or not they were Turkic, they cannot be directly linked with the Kazakhs.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 3vw">Russian and Soviet rule</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 2.3vw">The reverses experienced by the Kazakhs at the hands of the Dzungars undoubtedly retarded the emergence of a unified Kazakh state and further depressed the prevailing level of Kazakh cultural life. They also rendered the Kazakhs even less able to resist the encroachments of Russia from the north. The advance onto the Kazakh steppe began with the construction of a line of forts—Omsk in 1716, Semipalatinsk in 1718, Ust-Kamenogorsk in 1719, and Orsk in 1735—which was then steadily advanced southward. The Russian advance into Kazakh territory was slow and seldom violent but ineluctable; it made full use of Kazakh internal divisions and dissensions but was, in its essence, the typical encroachment of sedentary agriculturalists into the lands of nomads. Russian occupation of the Kazakh steppe would prove essential for the conquest of Muslim Central Asia.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size:3vw ">Kazakhstan to c. 1700 CE</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 2.3vw">Kazakhstan declared its sovereignty on October 25, 1990, and full independence on December 16, 1991. Under the presidency of Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakh politics continued to follow the moderate line of Kunayev. Nazarbayev’s leadership was initially restrained, relative to the leadership of neighbouring Central Asian states; however, over time it grew increasingly authoritarian.</p>
