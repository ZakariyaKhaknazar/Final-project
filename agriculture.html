  <p class="text2">The total value of Kazakhstan’s agricultural output was approximately USD 12.7 billion in 2019.  This was an increase of 1 percent over 2018, due to a 4 percent increase in cattle production and a 1.7 percent decrease in the grain crop affected with drought in 2019.  Approximately 75% of the country’s territory is suitable for agricultural production, but  only about 30% of the land is currently under agricultural production.  Farmers raise sheep and cattle, and livestock products include dairy goods, leather, meat and wool.  The country’s major crops are wheat, barley, cotton and rice, with wheat exports a major source of foreign currency.  Kazakhstan is one of the top 10 grain exporters in the world, exporting to over 70 countries.  The International Grains Council forecasts wheat and barley productions in Kazakhstan for 2020-2021 at 12.9 and 4 million tons respectively.</p>

<p class="text2">
	Kazakhstan has substantial untapped agricultural potential, yet its agricultural sector is underdeveloped and under-financed.  Despite serving as the country's major employer, the agriculture sector in Kazakhstan comes in a distant second to the industrial sector in attracting government attention for investment and support.
State owned company KazAgroFinance JSC is a leading organization in the market, providing leasing and financing services to the agriculture sector.  More than half of all agricultural machinery imported into Kazakhstan has been financially supported by KazAgroFinance.  To increase cooperation and provide easy access to information on local and foreign producers of agricultural equipment, KazAgroFinance created the Electronic Supplier Base that serves as a bridge between local agricultural sector and international equipment suppliers.  The database includes more than 350 suppliers and more than 10,000 projects supported.
Two additional state-owned financial organizations in the agriculture sector are the Fund for Financial Support of Agriculture JSC that provides micro crediting for agriculture SMEs and rural populations, and the Kazakh Agrarian Credit Corporation, a financial institution providing loans and financial support to agricultural producers.
